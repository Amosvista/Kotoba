# Dictionary

Quickly search the built-in iOS dictionary to see definitions of words.

App concept, as defined by @gruber in DM to @DFstyleguide:

> Ever find a good iPhone dictionary app?
>
> Best I’ve found is Terminology, but it’s so bad I usually just fire up Vesper and use the system “Define” service.
>
> The system one is good; and it’s perfect for when I’m reading in an app. I find it fiddly to use though when I’m reading a printed book.
>
> I want:
> 1. Open dictionary app.
> 2. Start typing word to look up.
> 3. Read definition.
>
> Instead I have to:
> 1. Open Vesper
> 2. Open a note
> 3. Type the word I’m looking for
> 4. Select the word, tap Define
> 5. Read definition.
> 6. Close dictionary and delete the word from my note.
